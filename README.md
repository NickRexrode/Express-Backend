# Express-Backend
The backend for nickrexrode.com and my Discord Bot

Created using Typescript and Express.  Connects to a SQL database.  API Endpoints are intended to follow a CRUD setup.

Currently in the middle of rewriting and refactoring this to update it with newer concepts, fix major problems, and to improve readability.
